  aboutMe:
  
  "I am a multidisciplinary engineer with expertise in both software and hardware development, passionate about building smart systems that bridge the digital and physical worlds. My skill set spans web technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and MySQL, as well as programming languages including Python, C, and C++. On the hardware side, I specialize in embedded systems, robotics, and IoT development, with hands-on experience using Arduino, ESP32, and Raspberry Pi platforms. I have a strong background in circuit design, sensors and actuators, motion control, and electronics, enabling me to design and integrate systems from the ground up. Beyond development, I am skilled in system integration, hardware and software debugging, reverse engineering, and technical repairs, ensuring that the solutions I build are both functional and reliable. I also explore image processing and automation, applying innovative approaches to robotics and machine systems. Driven by curiosity and problem-solving, I enjoy working on projects that combine creativity, engineering, and technology to deliver impactful solutions.",
